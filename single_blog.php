                    At every moment you can tell if the vibration that you are sending is either a positive one
                    or a negative one by identifying the feeling you are experiencing. At every moment you have
                    a feeling and that feeling is causing you to emit or send off a vibration – and in the
                    ‘vibrational’ world there are only two kinds of vibrations; positive or negative. So as you
                    talk about what you don’t want and make negative declarative statements, in that moment you
                    are sending out and emitting a negative vibration. Law of Attraction then matches it by
                    giving you more of the same.

            You can reset your vibration from a negative one to a positive one by simply choosing different
            words and different thoughts. It’s as easy as asking yourself, “So what do I want?” As I’ve said
            before, when you talk about what you don’t want and then talk about what you do want the words
            change.

            <span class="link_in_users">@Mass Impressions</span> When the words change the vibration changes and
            you can only hold one vibration at
            a time. In other words, you are resetting your vibration.

            The best news of all is that the Law of Attraction doesn’t remember what vibration you were sending
            out five minutes ago, five days ago, five months ago or 50 years ago. And the Law of Attraction
            doesn’t keep score of how long you may have been sending out or emitting a vibration. It’s only
            checking on the vibration you are offering right now in this very moment.
            and matching it with more of the same.

            Remember, the Law of Attraction always matches vibrations in the current moment (hence the
            expression, the point of power is in the present.) You are always at choice as to whether you want
            to reset your vibration or keep it as it is. If you like what you’re getting, celebrate it and in
            your celebration you’ll get more of the same from the Law of Attraction. If you don’t like what you
            are getting, use your reset button to change your vibration which will change the results you are
            experiencing.
